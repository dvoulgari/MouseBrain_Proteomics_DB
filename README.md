# MouseBrain_Proteomics_DB

## Introduction
This project is the **final assignment for the Biotechnology course**, focusing on **omics data processing and database design**.  
The aim is to **analyze, evaluate, and present proteomics data** derived from **mouse brain regions**, integrating results from different sources and performing **functional annotation** using **Gene Ontology (GO)**.

---

## Project Goals

### 1️⃣ Data Correlation
- Identify **common and unique proteins** across different **mouse brain regions**.  
- Compare results with **previously published studies**, both **globally** and **per brain region**.

### 2️⃣ Data Evaluation
- Classify the proteins **by Gene Ontology (GO)** using the **UniProt database**.  
- Generate **functional categorizations** for each brain region.  

### 3️⃣ Database Development
- Final deliverable: **Design and implementation of a database** storing the processed proteomics data.  
- Enables **querying, filtering, and visualization** of results.

---

## Usage
The project deliverables include:

- **`Biotech_Final_Project.ipynb`** – Full report with workflow, analysis, and results.  
- **Final Presentation**
- **Brain Proteome Database Architecture** explanation file

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn 
- Jupyter Notebook

It serves as a **proof of concept** for handling **large-scale omics datasets** and preparing them for **biological interpretation and visualization**.
